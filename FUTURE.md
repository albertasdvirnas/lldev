# Future
All notable future additions to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

### proposals/thoughts
I think in the future we could split CBT into two parts (two gui's or scripts, one for theory and something else for comparisons, like there's ETE for experiments vs experiments), since theory generation can be used for many other tools, and there's duplication sometimes (there's HCA_theory which computes essentially the same).
